   Internet Relay Chat client for Windows. By Dave Côté.
   Im Doing this because im tired of the old looking mirc..
	 asking for a paid registration 22 years after being outdated.
	 TOTO is in french of course because im from somewhere in quebec
	 but the software is all english. Also, todo was created hours after
	 project initializaion so not everything is in it.
------------------
  wIRC is a Windows based IRC Client. It work on almost every windows version starting from xp to 11 (may require some system fix for the later) 
  The application is made using Visual Basic 6.0, while many could argue this choice i'd just answer them that im doing VB6 since my early fifteen,
  it's the first language i've learnt and, i still love to get into it even nowaday... For something as basic as an IRC client i told my self, why not!

  So you might need to install and fix Visual Basic 6.0 Runtimes for it to run but it's no big job. I could eventually provide something for that, if asked.

  My goal on doing wIRC is to get rid of the old outdated mIRC who's always asking for a paid registration 22 years after being obselete.

  Im open to suggestions, i know there are issues but remember you're in early.
